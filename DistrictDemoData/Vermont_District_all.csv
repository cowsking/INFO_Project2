"Estimates in the People, Workers, Housing, Socioeconomic, and Education tabs are from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an annual household survey developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to replace the long form of the decennial census program.

"An '-' entry in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution.",,,,
An '-' following a median estimate means the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution.,,,,
An '+' following a median estimate means the median falls in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution.,,,,
An '***' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.,,,,
An '*****' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate.,,,,
An 'N' entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.,,,,
An '(X)' means that the estimate is not applicable or not available,,,,

"The Census Bureau did not collect district boundaries for the 117th Congress, in keeping with the practice of not collecting the session which aligns with the decennial census. ",,,,
American Community Survey and County Business Patterns for districts in North Carolina are not currently available.  Estimates for the 116th Congressional districts and state and local geographies are available at data.census.gov.,,,,

"1. CBP data includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, and annual payroll. CBP basic data are extracted from the Business Register (BR), a database of all known single and multi-establishment employer companies maintained and updated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Primary causes of differences between CBP employment estimates and ACS estimates: CBP does not cover the self-employed, public employment, and most agricultural employment; CBP estimates are not based on a sample survey; they represent business location as opposed to workers' residence in the district; use the week of March 12 as a reference period; and use a business source to determine industry.",,,,
2. Industries not classified - Industry could not be determined.,,,,
"3. Statewide - County Business Patterns data includes employers without a fixed location within a state (or of unknown county location), these are included under a 'statewide' classification. Statewide cases are not included in any particular congressional district (though they would be included in at-large districts). This incomplete detail causes only a slight understatement of a district's total estimates.",,,,
